Measures execution time of every action and filter callback to identify performance bottlenecks by plugin, theme, or core.

== Description ==

Hook Profiler wraps every WordPress action and filter callback and records its execution time using `hrtime()`. Results are displayed in an overlay debug panel accessible from the admin bar — no page reload required.

**Key features:**

* Plugin overview — total execution time and callback count per plugin
* Slowest callbacks — ranked list of the slowest individual callbacks across all hooks
* Hook details — per-hook breakdown with filtering by plugin
* Plugin loading analysis — early-boot timing via an optional mu-plugin shim
* Advanced search and sorting across all views
* Memory guard — pauses profiling at 80 % of `memory_limit` to prevent OOM crashes
* Callback cap — limits tracked entries to prevent unbounded memory growth
* Multisite compatible (`Network: true`)

Hook Profiler is intended for **development and staging environments**. Deactivate it on production sites once you have identified your bottlenecks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hook-profiler` directory to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin (or network admin for multisite).
3. Visit any page while logged in as an administrator.
4. Click the **Hooks** item in the admin bar to open the debug panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this slow down my site? =

The profiler adds a small constant overhead to every hook invocation. Use it in development, not on live traffic.

= How do I raise the memory or callback limits? =

```php
// Pause profiling at 70 % of memory_limit instead of 80 %
add_filter( 'wp_hook_profiler_memory_threshold', fn() => 0.70 );

// Track up to 1 000 unique callback+hook pairs instead of 500
add_filter( 'wp_hook_profiler_max_callbacks', fn() => 1000 );

// Allow up to 200 hook entries per plugin instead of 100
add_filter( 'wp_hook_profiler_max_hooks_per_plugin', fn() => 200 );
```

= Does it work on multisite? =

Yes. The plugin header declares `Network: true` and the mu-plugin shim is installed network-wide.

== Screenshots ==

1. Admin bar indicator showing total hooks and cumulative execution time.
2. Plugins overview tab — sortable table of per-plugin execution time.
3. Slowest callbacks tab — ranked list of the slowest individual callbacks.
4. Hook details tab — per-hook breakdown with plugin filter.
